#🏏 IPL Analyzer & Predictor (2008–2025)
This project is an all-in-one data science platform that combines Deep Analytics with Machine Learning to decode the world’s biggest cricket league. Using a massive dataset from 2008 to 2025, it bridges the gap between historical facts and future forecasts. 📊

🔍 1. The IPL Analyzer
The "brain" of the project that turns raw numbers into visual stories:

Team DNA: Tracks win/loss patterns, home-ground dominance, and championship consistency. 🏆

Player Power: Ranks athletes using custom metrics like Impact Scores and Pressure-Handling stats. ⭐

Venue Intelligence: Identifies high-scoring "belters" vs. slow, spin-friendly tracks. 🏟️

Toss Logic: Visualizes how much a simple coin flip changes the game's outcome. 🪙

🔮 2. The IPL Predictor
The "engine" that uses AI to see into the future:

Win Probability: Employs XGBoost and Random Forest to calculate real-time winning chances based on teams, venue, and line-ups. 📈

Score Forecasting: Uses Recursive Regression to predict final innings totals, accounting for current run rate and wickets lost. 🏏

H2H Dominance: A "Power User" feature that weighs historical rivalries (like MI vs. CSK) to adjust final predictions. ⚔️

💻 3. Technical Stack
Data: 17+ years of ball-by-ball history (2008–2025). 📂

Models: Random Forest, XGBoost, and Seasonal Time-Series logic. 🤖

Interface: Interactive Streamlit dashboard for instant, user-friendly predictions. 🖥️
